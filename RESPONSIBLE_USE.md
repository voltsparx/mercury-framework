# Responsible Use

Mercury Framework v3.0 is built for safe simulation and defensive training only.

Rules:
- Use only in environments you own or where you have explicit written authorization.
- Keep all activity in isolated labs (VMs, emulators, or offline containers).
- Do not deploy this project on production endpoints.
- Do not attempt unauthorized access, persistence, or data exfiltration.
- Document scope, timing, and approvals before every exercise.

If you discover behavior that could be unsafe, report it through `SECURITY.md`.
