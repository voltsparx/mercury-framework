# Contributing to Mercury Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project aims to be an educational,
safe scaffold for security research. Contributions are welcome but must follow the
project's safety and responsible-use policies.

Before you contribute

- Read `RESPONSIBLE_USE.md` and `SECURITY.md`.
- Ensure your code is harmless by design (simulations, benign demos, tests).
- Do not add functionality that can be used to access or exfiltrate data from real devices.

Submitting changes

- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and open a pull request.
- Include tests for any new behavior and update `README.md` if usage changes.
- For any change that could be misunderstood, leave a clear explanation in the PR.

Code style

- Keep code readable and well-documented.
- Use type hints where appropriate.

Thank you - and stay ethical.
