# Contributing to Mercury Framework v3.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project aims to be an educational,
safe scaffold for security research. Contributions are welcome but must follow the
project's safety and responsible-use policies.

Before you contribute

- Read `RESPONSIBLE_USE.md` and `SECURITY.md`.
- Ensure your code is harmless by design (simulations, benign demos, tests).
- Do not add functionality that can be used to access or exfiltrate data from real devices.
- Use the provided issue templates and PR template under `.github/`.

Submitting changes

- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and open a pull request.
- Include tests for any new behavior and update `README.md` if usage changes.
- For any change that could be misunderstood, leave a clear explanation in the PR.
- Ensure CI quality gates pass (lint, type-check, tests, coverage, manifest validation).
- CODEOWNERS and release-drafter automation are enforced under `.github/`.

Code style

- Keep code readable and well-documented.
- Use type hints where appropriate.

Thank you - and stay ethical.
