A. About
Mercury Framework v3.0 is an advanced safe simulation framework for authorized security labs.

B. Beginner Mode
Run python run.py --wizard for guided prompts.

C. Command Mode
Run python run.py -c "modules" for a single command or python run.py -s commands.txt for scripts.

D. Diagnostics
Run python run.py --doctor to check environment, plugin state, and report directory health.

E. Entry Points
Use python run.py, python -m mercury, or mercury.

F. Features
Framework includes plugin lifecycle execution, local-only safety checks, Docker isolation, reports, multi-device simulation profiles, and CI quality gates with core-module coverage threshold.

G. Getting Started
Use python run.py --quickstart for the fastest onboarding flow.

H. Help
Use python run.py --help for all flags and examples.

I. Installation
Create a virtual environment and run python -m pip install -e .

J. JSON Reports
Plugin runs generate JSON reports under reports/.

K. Known Safety Policy
Only run in isolated environments with explicit authorization.

L. Launcher Flags
Common flags: --wizard, --quickstart, --doctor, --show-metadata, --list-plugins, --docker.

M. Metadata

Version tag: v3.0

N. Non-Interactive Usage
Use -c and -s flags for CI, automation, and repeatable training workflows.

O. Output
Console uses ANSI color themes from the internal color system.

P. Plugin Management
Use modules and info <plugin> in console to inspect plugin metadata and safe-use notes.

Q. Quickstart
Quickstart runs metadata, diagnostics, device summary, plugin list, and a baseline healthcheck plugin.

R. Reporting
Reports are written to reports/ as JSON and Markdown.
Release tags generate hardened artifacts with checksums, signatures, SBOM, and provenance.

S. Scopes
Do not target production or unauthorized systems.

T. Themes
Use --theme mercury, --theme sunset, or --theme mono.

U. Usage Basics
Launch console: python run.py
Run plugin: run incident_reporter run
Switch device profile: device use windows_workstation

V. Versioning
Current project package version is 3.0.0 and user-facing label is v3.0.

W. Windows Docker
Build with .\sandbox\build_windows.ps1 and run with .\sandbox\run_windows.ps1.

X. External Access
Docker mode uses network isolation defaults with no external network access.

Y. Your Responsibility
Operators are responsible for legal and ethical use, and contribution workflows use issue templates, pull request template, and CODEOWNERS governance.

Z. Zero Trust Mindset
Treat all simulation outputs as training data, validate assumptions, and document all exercises.
